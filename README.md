# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, I upload my solutions to various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), covering a wide range of topics in algorithms and data structures. This repository serves as both a personal coding journal and a reference for others who are also practicing problem-solving skills.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by problem category and difficulty level to help you navigate easily. Each problem is saved as an individual file, generally with the following structure:


### Directory Layout

- **Difficulty Levels**: Each solution file includes the problem difficulty level (`Easy`, `Medium`, or `Hard`) as noted on LeetCode.

## üöÄ Progress

I regularly update this repository as I work through more problems. My current progress includes:
- **Total Problems Solved**: 25
- **Difficulty Breakdown**:
  - Easy: 18 problems
  - Medium: 7 problems
  - Hard: 0 problems

## üìå Topics Covered

This repository includes solutions across a variety of topics, such as:
- **Array and String Manipulation**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Theory**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
  
## üíª Code Style and Approach

Each solution follows clean, consistent coding practices:
- **Clarity**: Each solution is designed to be easy to read and understand.
- **Efficiency**: Wherever possible, solutions aim for optimal time and space complexity.
- **Comments**: I include comments explaining key sections of the code to provide insights into the thought process.

## üåü Why This Repository?

This repository is meant to:
- **Document my learning**: It‚Äôs a way to track my progress and reflect on the problems I‚Äôve solved.
- **Help others**: I hope others may find these solutions helpful for learning or debugging their own code.
- **Practice my coding skills**: Working on LeetCode regularly helps me improve problem-solving and coding proficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The solutions are primarily written in:
- **Java**

I might expand this list as I practice with additional languages.

## ü§ù Contributions

While this repository is primarily for my own use, I welcome feedback! If you have suggestions for optimizing any of the solutions, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.

## üìà Future Plans

- Regularly add more solutions to problems as I solve them.
- Add more comments and explanations to existing solutions for clarity.
- Possibly include problem descriptions and solution breakdowns in a markdown format for in-depth understanding.
